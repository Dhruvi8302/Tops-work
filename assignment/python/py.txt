Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language widely recognized for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.
Key Characteristics and Features:
Readability and Simple Syntax: Python emphasizes code readability with its clean and straightforward syntax, often employing significant indentation to define code blocks. This makes it easier to learn and understand, especially for beginners.
High-Level Language: Python handles complex tasks like memory management automatically, allowing developers to focus on problem-solving rather than low-level system details.
Interpreted Language: Python code is executed line by line by an interpreter, eliminating the need for a separate compilation step. This facilitates rapid prototyping and debugging.
Multi-Paradigm Support: Python supports various programming paradigms, including object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming, offering flexibility in how developers structure their code.
